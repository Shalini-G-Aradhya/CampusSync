# CampusSync
CampusSync is a unified AI-powered campus platform designed to centralize communication, assistance, and operations within a college environment. It brings together official notices, lost & found, campus issue reporting, an AI help desk, campus navigation, and study planning into a single, easy-to-use system.

## Problem Statement
In most campuses, important information is scattered across emails, messaging groups, portals, and notice boards. This fragmentation leads to missed announcements, delayed issue resolution, inefficient lost & found handling, and repetitive queries from students. Faculty and administrators also struggle to manage communication and respond efficiently due to the lack of a centralized platform.

## Solution
